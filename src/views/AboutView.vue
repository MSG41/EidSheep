    <h1>About Eid al-Adha</h1>
    <p>
      Eid al-Adha, also known as the Feast of Sacrifice, is one of the most important festivals
      celebrated by Muslims around the world. It commemorates the willingness of Ibrahim (Abraham)
      to sacrifice his son as an act of obedience to God's command. Just as Ibrahim was about to
      sacrifice his son, God provided a ram as a substitute, symbolizing a great act of mercy and
      compassion.

    <p>
      The festival is observed on the 10th day of Dhu al-Hijjah, the final month of the Islamic
      lunar calendar. It marks the end of the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca and is a time for Muslims to
      come together with family and friends to celebrate and reflect on the values of sacrifice,
      faith, and unity.

      One of the distinctive features of Eid al-Adha is the sacrificial ritual, where Muslims who
      are financially able offer an animal, usually a sheep, as a symbolic sacrifice. The meat of
      the sacrificed animal is divided into three parts: one-third for the family, one-third for
      relatives and friends, and one-third for the less fortunate. This act of sharing and giving
      reflects the spirit of generosity and charity that is central to Eid al-Adha.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to the sacrificial ritual, Muslims also attend special prayers at the mosque,
      listen to sermons that emphasize the significance of the occasion, exchange greetings and
      gifts, and indulge in festive meals and sweets. It is a time of joy, gratitude, and community
      bonding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eid al-Adha is not only a religious festival but also a time for Muslims to strengthen their
      relationship with Allah and seek forgiveness. It serves as a reminder of the importance of
      selflessness, compassion, and devotion in one's life.
